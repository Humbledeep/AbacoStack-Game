Run Game.py

The game is played by a user, not the computer. 

The computer would generate a random configuration card and the user would have to solve the game by indicating the moves to do in order to change the configuration from the initial one to the one indicated on the card.

The moves are indicated by the following input pair ij where i is a digit and j a character like the following:

* 1u means stack 1 upward move
* 1d means stack 1 downward move
* 2u means stack 2 upward move
* 2d means stack 2 downward move
* 3u means stack 3 upward move
* 3d means stack 3 downward move
* 0r means position 0 right move
* 1r and 1l mean position 1 right move and left move respectively
* 2r and 2l mean position 2 right move and left move respectively
* 3r and 3l mean position 3 right move and left move respectively
* 4l means position 4 left move
